Push_Swap 42 Project

What I'm proud about :

For 100 numbers stacks, this is the result I get :

My best is 425 ! The results are all extremely low, and they all have very close results. There's less than a hundred instructions difference between the worst and the best result.

It was my first "real" project, because I really enjoyed it, and pushed it to its limits. The code is really awful to go through but the results are there. It tought me that perseverance can really make me obtain good results. It made me enjoy computing science a LOT !
